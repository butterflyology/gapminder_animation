I want to teach `gganimate` in November so I am recreating some iconic visualizations to go through with my class.

Commits:

1. 2019-10-21: Initial commit. Got the Rosling plot for `gapminder` pretty close (needs larger points). Also the `diamonds` plot from Pederson.
1. 2019-11-10: Creating the `.Rmd` file with the tutorial.
