I want to teach `gganimate` in November so I am recreating some iconic visualizations to go through with my class.

Commits:

1. 2019-10-21: Initial commit. Got the Rosling plot for `gapminder` pretty close (needs larger points). Also the `diamonds` plot from Pederson.
1. 2019-11-10: Creating the `.Rmd` file with the tutorial.
1. 2019-11-22: Splitting the parts into tabs to reduce file size and improve flow / readability.
1. 2019-12-06: Started work on creating tabs for each section and adding a footer. Started branch `tabs`. Still need to outline this at a higher level.
1. 2019-12-07: Wrote the `_style.yml` file and began to populate the individual `.Rmd` files and create the pages.
1. 2019-12-09: Adding more pages of the tutorial.
